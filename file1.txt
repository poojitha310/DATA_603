the twinkling light that usually shone from
Dumbledore’
s eyes seemed to have gone out.
“W
ell,” said Dumbledore finally
, “that’
s that. W
e’ve no
business staying here. W
e may as well go and join the
celebrations.”
“Y
eah,” said Hagrid in a very muf
fled voice, “I’d best
get this bike away
. G’night, Professor McGonagall —
Professor Dumbledore, sir
.”
W
iping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid
swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the
engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and of
f
into the night.
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,”
said Dumbledore, nodding to her
. Professor
McGonagall blew her nose in reply
.
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.
On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-
Outer
. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light
sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive
glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a
www.ztcprep.com
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end
of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets
on the step of number four
.
“Good luck, Harry
,” he murmured. He turned on his
heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.
A breeze ruf
fled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which
lay silent and tidy under the inky sky
, the very last

place you would expect astonishing things to happen.
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without
waking up. One small hand closed on the letter
beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was
special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he
would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs.
Dursley’
s scream as she opened the front door to put
out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next
few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin
Dudley
. … He couldn’
t know that at this very
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country
www.ztcprep.com
were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed
voices: “T
o Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”

THE V
ANASHIG GLASS
Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had
woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but
Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose
on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into
their living room, which was almost exactly the same
as it had been on the night when Mr
. Dursley had
seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the
photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how
www.ztcprep.com
much time had passed. T
en years ago, there had been
lots of pictures of what looked like a lar
ge pink beach
ball wearing dif
ferent-colored bonnets — but Dudley
Dursley was no longer a baby
, and now the
photographs showed a lar
ge blond boy riding his first
bicycle, on a carousel at the fair
, playing a computer
game with his father
, being hugged and kissed by his
mother
. The room held no sign at all that another boy
lived in the house, too.
Y
et Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment,
but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it
P a g e

Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone – J.K. Rowling
was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day
.
“Up! Get up! Now!”
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door
again.
“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward
the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan
being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and
www.ztcprep.com
tried to remember the dream he had been having. It
had been a good one. There had been a flying
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the
same dream before.
His aunt was back outside the door
.
“Are you up yet?” she demanded.
“Nearly
,” said Harry
.
“W
ell, get a move on, I want you to look after the
bacon. And don’
t you dare let it burn, I want
everything perfect on Duddy’
s birthday
.”
Harry groaned.
“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the
door
.
“Nothing, nothing …”
Dudley’
s birthday — how could he have for
gotten?
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for
socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after
pulling a spider of
f one of them, put them on. Harry
was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the
stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.

When he was dressed he went down the hall into the
kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all
Dudley’
s birthday presents. It looked as though
Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not
to mention the second television and the racing bike.
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a
mystery to Harry
, as Dudley was very fat and hated
exercise — unless of course it involved punching
somebody
. Dudley’
s favorite punching bag was Harry
,
but he couldn’
t often catch him. Harry didn’
t look it,
but he was very fast.
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark
cupboard, but Harry had always been small and
skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
skinnier than he really was because all he had to
wear were old clothes of Dudley’
s, and Dudley was
about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin
face, knobbly knees, black hair
, and bright green
www.ztcprep.com
eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot
of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked
about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his
forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He
had had it as long as he could remember
, and the
first question he could ever remember asking his
Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had
said. “And don’
t ask questions.”
Don’
t ask questions
 — that was the first rule for a
quiet life with the Dursleys.
Uncle V
ernon entered the kitchen as Harry was
turning over the bacon.
“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning
greeting.
P a g e

About once a week, Uncle V
ernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
shouted that Harry needed a
haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the
www.ztcprep.com
rest of the boys in his class put together
, but it made
no dif
ference, his hair simply grew that way — all over
the place.
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in
the kitchen with his mother
. Dudley looked a lot like
Uncle V
ernon. He had a lar
ge pink face, not much
neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair
that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia
often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel —
Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a
wig.
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table,
which was dif
ficult as there wasn’
t much room.
Dudley
, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His
face fell.
“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and
father
. “That’
s two less than last year
.”
“Darling, you haven’
t counted Auntie Mar
ge’
s present,
see, it’
s here under this big one from Mommy and
Daddy
.”
www.ztcprep.com
“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley
, going red
in the face. Harry
, who could see a huge Dudley
tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as
fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over
.
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger
, too, because
she said quickly
, “And we’ll buy you another 
two
presents while we’re out today
. How’
s that, popkin?
T
wo
 more presents. Is that all right?”
P a g e

Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard
work. Finally he said slowly
, “So I’ll have thirty …
thirty …”
“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.
“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the
nearest parcel. “All right then.”
Uncle V
ernon chuckled.
“Little tyke wants his money’
s worth, just like his
father
. ’Atta boy
, Dudley!” He ruf
fled Dudley’
s hair
.
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia
www.ztcprep.com
went to answer it while Harry and Uncle V
ernon
watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video
camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new
computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the
paper of
f a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came
back from the telephone looking both angry and
worried.
“Bad news, V
ernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’
s broken her
leg. She can’
t take him.” She jerked her head in
Harry’
s direction.
Dudley’
s mouth fell open in horror
, but Harry’
s heart
gave a leap. Every year on Dudley’
s birthday
, his
parents took him and a friend out for the day
, to
adventure parks, hambur
ger restaurants, or the
movies. Every year
, Harry was left behind with Mrs.
Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away
.
Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of
cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs
of all the cats she’d ever owned.
“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at
www.ztcprep.com
Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he
P a g e 
| 24
Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone – J.K. Rowling
ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’
t easy
when he reminded himself it would
be a whole year before he had to look at T
ibbies,
Snowy
, Mr
. Paws, and T
ufty again.
“W
e could phone Mar
ge,” Uncle V
ernon suggested.
“Don’
t be silly
, V
ernon, she hates the boy
.”
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as
though he wasn’
t there — or rather
, as though he was
something very nasty that couldn’
t understand them,
like a slug.
“What about what’
s-her
-name, your friend —
Y
vonne?”
“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.
“Y
ou could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully
(he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television
for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’
s
computer).
Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a
